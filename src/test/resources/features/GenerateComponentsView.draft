Feature: Generate Component Views
  As a developer,
  I want to automate generation of Component Views
  so that Component documentation can be quickly updated

  Scenario: Find Spring Components
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
      And a piece of software has a Spring-annotated class named "Component1"
    When the Component view is generated
    Then the view has an internal component named "Component1"

  Scenario: Default Actor
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
    When the Component view is generated
    Then the view has an external actor named "Client"

  Scenario: Named Default Actor
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
      And given a default actor named "Actor1"
    When the Component view is generated
    Then the view has an external actor named "Actor1"

  Scenario: Default Actor Relationships
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
      And a piece of software has a Spring-annotated class named "Component1"
    When the Components view is generated
    Then the view has a synchronous relationship from "Client" to "Component1"

  Scenario: Find Package Components
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
      And the piece of software has 2 main namespaces
    When the Components view is generated
    Then the view has 2 internal components

  Scenario: Find Package Relationships
    Given a piece of software implementing a container
      And the piece of software has 2 main namespaces
      And namespace1 has a class calling a class in namespace2
    When the Components view is generated
    Then the view has a synchronous relationship from namespace1 to namespace2
